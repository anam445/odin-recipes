    <p>This recipe for au gratin potatoes with Gruyère makes the easiest, cheesiest, most delicious potatoes I have ever
        had. Yum!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream, divided</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>freshly grated nutmeg to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups freshly shredded Gruyere cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
        <li>step 2</li>
        <p>Place potatoes, garlic, and salt into a large pot; fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium and simmer potatoes until tender but not mushy, 8 to 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer about half the potatoes into a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>Pour 1/2 of the cream over the potatoes and season with black pepper and nutmeg; sprinkle 1/2 of the Gruyère cheese on top. Layer the remaining potatoes on top and season with black pepper and nutmeg. Pour over remaining cream and sprinkle with remaining Gruyère cheese.</p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is golden brown on top, about 1 hour.</p>
    </ol>
